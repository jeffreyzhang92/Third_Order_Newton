# Third_Order_Newton
Code and Data for "An Unregularized Third Order Newton Method"


The code "Newton Functions.py" initializes functions, including derivative definitions and search bounds.
The function "Newton_Fractal.py" generates the fractals for each function. Uses "Newton Functions.py".
Each .npy "Fractal#_{Function}" contains limit points for the second and third order from each starting point, as generated from the code.

# Third_Order_Newton
Code and Data for "An Unregularized Third Order Newton Method"


The code "Function_Definitions.py" initializes functions, including derivative definitions and search bounds.
The function "Fractal_Code.py" generates the fractals for each function, assuming initializations through "Function_Definitions.py".
Each .npy "Fractal#_{Function}" contains limit points for the second and third order from each starting point, as generated from the code.
